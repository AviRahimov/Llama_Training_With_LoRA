    "# Llama 3.2 1B LoRA Fine-tuning - Local Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model on Llama 3.2 1B using your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended for faster training)\n",
    "2. **RAM**: At least 8GB of system RAM\n",
    "3. **Storage**: ~10GB free space for models and data\n",
    "4. **Hugging Face Account**: For model access\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hugging Face Token**: \n",
    "   - Get your token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens\n",
    "   - Set it as environment variable: `set HF_TOKEN=your_token_here` (Windows)\n",
    "   - Or replace the token directly in the authentication cell\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data File**: \n",
    "   - Ensure `combined_human_conversations.csv` is in your Documents folder\n",
    "   - Or update the file path in the data loading cell\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run cells in order** - the first cell will install all required packages\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook does\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tunes Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model using LoRA\n",
    "- Uses 4-bit quantization to reduce memory usage\n",
    "- Trains on conversational data in \"Human 1/Human 2\" format\n",
    "- Saves the trained adapter for later use"
