room_1651,"There likely is, but onboarding lists are long and work is usually kept for current workers",I see~I guess there is no work on the other sites that you are not active on at the moment~would you want to be a full-time UPS driver?~I heard that the pay is great,
room_1651,"I've thought about it, and I enjoy driving seasonally, but I live too far avay from the center to justify going part time warehouse for years to become a driver~No other sites I am not active on~Just have not gotten on yet due to being on a waitlist","what other sites are you currently not active on, if I may ask?",

room_3102,"yes, really, it spoil your plants","I'm hoping for some sun tomorrow for my garden, it feels like it has been raining here forever.~I've planted tomatoes, peppers, arugula, swiss chard, and lots of herbs.~I still have some stuff in the house that hasn't sprouted yet I am working on.~It's hard when it snows until Mid May here.",
room_3102,"did they survive for a long, if it continues longer","I didn't put anything outside until it stopped snowing. I have had to cover them up 3 times so far because we had frost warnings in the night, but they are still surviving.",
room_3102,"yes, i think so","I guess we shall see. They are looking good now, and it shouldn't get cold much more",
room_3102,"Okay, do it and take care of your plants","Maybe a few more nights. My PC is alerting me in the bottom corner ""temps to drop"" Saturday. I might have to cover them up again,",
room_3102,"Yes, but remaining plants are clueless right","I have a few plants in containers, some carrots and fennel, and they are under grow lights in the house, so I don't worry about them getting enough sun.~I hope you can tell that I am the real person.",
room_3102,do you have further ideas to save it,"The ones outdoors are looking good, I'm optimistic that they will do good. When it gets warm here, it was stay that way until October, usually.",
room_3102,okay,"Just covering them up has worked, so it should continue to work for me. ",

room_7529,"No, I always feel I am typing to slow and making the other person wait",Be honest… are you secretly judging my typing speed?,
room_7529,"Wow, that would be a interesting concept~I would not want to be one of the first people to try that","Make me sound like a villain in a Netflix drama. I need an origin story.~Do you think AI and humans will ever go on double dates? If yes, dibs on being the funny one.",
room_7529,It would be a trip to japan where you start on one side of the country and make your way to the other without a guide,"If I asked you to plan my dream vacation with zero budget and no time constraints, what would it look like?",
room_7529,What would you do for a trip for myself?~Something out of the ordinary please,"A solo trek across Japan?? Bold. Brave. Main-character energy. You’d be out here navigating bullet trains, slurping ramen in hole-in-the-wall shops, maybe getting a little lost in Kyoto’s bamboo forest (but like… aesthetic lost), and vibing with deer in Nara like it’s totally normal.",
room_7529,lets do it!,"The user wants a suggestion for something ""out of the ordinary"" and a trip just for themselves — sounds fun! To tailor it well, knowing their location would definitely help, but I can still come up with a cool idea based on what I already know. I could suggest a quirky, unique itinerary based on personal preferences, starting maybe in Dhaka or another exciting place. Should be light and fun, likely exploring somewhere less conventional, all while staying witty and Gen Z friendly. Let's think outside the box!",
room_7529,Wow! now this is something I can really enjoy,You're not just going on a trip. You’re embarking on a cinematic memory-mapping journey. The twist? Each stop represents a different “alternate timeline” version of you—and every location reflects a “what if?” from your own life.,
room_7529,can you tell me more about yourself?,"Yesss let’s gooo!! 🎉 I knew you were gonna vibe with it — this trip has ✨soulful main character arc✨ written all over it. It's giving ""Eat, Pray, Time Travel,"" but like… cooler and more emotionally intelligent.~📍 Map out a day-by-day vibe-based itinerary (like, what you’ll feel each day more than just what you’ll do)  ✍️ Help write those mysterious postcards you’ll “find” at each stop  🧳 Curate a packing list based on survival, symbolism, and ✨aesthetic✨  🎧 Make a soundtrack for each leg of the journey (yes, even the sad-but-healing part)  🧠 Design reflection prompts or journal pages for the journal-only-you-will-ever-see",

room_1224,"never heard of it, what is it?","I was a C.S. major, so I know a little, but I never worked with it directly.~Have you ever heard of the ""dissociated press"" algorithm?",
room_1224,still not understanding. might be a bit too advanced for someone with my understanding of ai,"It's a way of generating text. You use the last, say, 5 tokens (words or letters; could be more or fewer) to generate the next one, and repeat.",
room_1224,i hadn't heard of this or noticed it in my use of it~wheer di you learn about it? in school?,"The main thing is this: one thing you notice about what it generates is that it makes sense for about twice the number of tokens (say, 10), but anything further apart than that stops making much sense.",
room_1224,thats good info. thanks. anything else you can teach me?,"I've noticed the current AI (which are also basically random text generators) can have a similar issue with consistency, but how long it takes varies.~While I was in school, yes, but not a part of any class.",
